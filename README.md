# Development / Building

Only requirement for building is node.js (install here https://nodejs.org/en), 
any version should probably work but I used 20.16.0. Also I have only tested on a windows machine, but it *should* work on mac/linux. No releases yet as it's probably still buggy and I just want to finally put the code out there incase I stop working on it.


## clone project (or download zip from github)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/visgotti/slippi-ops.git
```


## install dependencies
```sh
cd slippi-ops
npm i
```


## start project

```sh
npx nx serve desktop
```
or 
```sh
npm run dev
```

if you want to build it and then just use the .exe you can do 
```sh
npx nx build desktop
```

it will build it to `/apps/desktop/dist/win-unpacked/Slippi Ops.exe`

## i've only tested on windows, if you want to *try* mac/linux:
```sh
cd apps/desktop
npm run build:mac 
npm run build:linux
```
